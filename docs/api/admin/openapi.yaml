    API reference for Medusa's Admin endpoints. All endpoints are prefixed with
    `/admin`.


    ## Authentication


    There are two ways to send authenticated requests to the Medusa server:
    Using a user's API token, or using a Cookie Session ID.


    <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <SecurityDefinitions> -->


    ## Expanding Fields


    In many endpoints you'll find an `expand` query parameter that can be passed
    to the endpoint. You can use the `expand` query parameter to unpack an
    entity's relations and return them in the response.


    Please note that the relations you pass to `expand` replace any relations
    that are expanded by default in the request.


    ### Expanding One Relation


    For example, when you retrieve products, you can retrieve their collection
    by passing to the `expand` query parameter the value `collection`:


    ```bash

    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?expand=collection" \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    ### Expanding Multiple Relations


    You can expand more than one relation by separating the relations in the
    `expand` query parameter with a comma.


    For example, to retrieve both the variants and the collection of products,
    pass to the `expand` query parameter the value `variants,collection`:


    ```bash

    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?expand=variants,collection" \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    ### Prevent Expanding Relations


    Some requests expand relations by default. You can prevent that by passing
    an empty expand value to retrieve an entity without any extra relations.


    For example:


    ```bash

    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?expand" \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    This would retrieve each product with only its properties, without any
    relations like `collection`.


    ## Selecting Fields


    In many endpoints you'll find a `fields` query parameter that can be passed
    to the endpoint. You can use the `fields` query parameter to specify which
    fields in the entity should be returned in the response.


    Please note that if you pass a `fields` query parameter, only the fields you
    pass in the value along with the `id` of the entity will be returned in the
    response.


    Also, the `fields` query parameter does not affect the expanded relations.
    You'll have to use the `expand` parameter instead.


    ### Selecting One Field


    For example, when you retrieve a list of products, you can retrieve only the
    titles of the products by passing `title` as a value to the `fields` query
    parameter:


    ```bash

    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?fields=title" \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    As mentioned above, the expanded relations such as `variants` will still be
    returned as they're not affected by the `fields` parameter.


    You can ensure that only the `title` field is returned by passing an empty
    value to the `expand` query parameter. For example:


    ```bash

    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?fields=title&expand" \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    ### Selecting Multiple Fields


    You can pass more than one field by seperating the field names in the
    `fields` query parameter with a comma.


    For example, to select the `title` and `handle` of products:


    ```bash

    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?fields=title,handle" \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    ### Retrieve Only the ID


    You can pass an empty `fields` query parameter to return only the ID of an
    entity. For example:


    ```bash

    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?fields" \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    You can also pair with an empty `expand` query parameter to ensure that the
    relations aren't retrieved as well. For example:


    ```bash

    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?fields&expand" \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    ## Query Parameter Types


    This section covers how to pass some common data types as query parameters.
    This is useful if you're sending requests to the API endpoints and not using
    our JS Client. For example, when using cURL or Postman.


    ### Strings


    You can pass a string value in the form of `<parameter_name>=<value>`.


    For example:


    ```bash

    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?title=Shirt" \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    If the string has any characters other than letters and numbers, you must
    encode them.


    For example, if the string has spaces, you can encode the space with `+` or
    `%20`:


    ```bash

    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?title=Blue%20Shirt" \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    You can use tools like [this one](https://www.urlencoder.org/) to learn how
    a value can be encoded.


    ### Integers


    You can pass an integer value in the form of `<parameter_name>=<value>`.


    For example:


    ```bash

    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?offset=1" \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    ### Boolean


    You can pass a boolean value in the form of `<parameter_name>=<value>`.


    For example:


    ```bash

    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?is_giftcard=true" \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    ### Date and DateTime


    You can pass a date value in the form `<parameter_name>=<value>`. The date
    must be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.


    For example:


    ```bash

    curl -g "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?created_at[lt]=2023-02-17" \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    You can also pass the time using the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. Please
    note that the `T` and `Z` here are fixed.


    For example:


    ```bash

    curl -g
    "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?created_at[lt]=2023-02-17T07:22:30Z" \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    ### Array


    Each array value must be passed as a separate query parameter in the form
    `<parameter_name>[]=<value>`. You can also specify the index of each
    parameter in the brackets `<parameter_name>[0]=<value>`.


    For example:


    ```bash

    curl -g
    "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?sales_channel_id[]=sc_01GPGVB42PZ7N3YQEP2WDM7PC7&sales_channel_id[]=sc_234PGVB42PZ7N3YQEP2WDM7PC7"
    \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    Note that the `-g` parameter passed to `curl` disables errors being thrown
    for using the brackets. Read more
    [here](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-g).


    ### Object


    Object parameters must be passed as separate query parameters in the form
    `<parameter_name>[<key>]=<value>`.


    For example:


    ```bash

    curl -g
    "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?created_at[lt]=2023-02-17&created_at[gt]=2022-09-17"
    \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    ## Pagination


    ### Query Parameters


    In listing endpoints, such as list customers or list products, you can
    control the pagination using the query parameters `limit` and `offset`.


    `limit` is used to specify the maximum number of items that can be return in
    the response. `offset` is used to specify how many items to skip before
    returning the resulting entities.


    You can use the `offset` query parameter to change between pages. For
    example, if the limit is 50, at page 1 the offset should be 0; at page 2 the
    offset should be 50, and so on.


    For example, to limit the number of products returned in the List Products
    endpoint:


    ```bash

    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?limit=5" \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    ### Response Fields


    In the response of listing endpoints, aside from the entities retrieved,
    there are three pagination-related fields returned: `count`, `limit`, and
    `offset`.


    Similar to the query parameters, `limit` is the maximum number of items that
    can be returned in the response, and `field` is the number of items that
    were skipped before the entities in the result.


    `count` is the total number of available items of this entity. It can be
    used to determine how many pages are there.


    For example, if the `count` is 100 and the `limit` is 50, you can divide the
    `count` by the `limit` to get the number of pages: `100/50 = 2 pages`.


    ### Sort Order


    The `order` field available on endpoints supporting pagination allows you to
    sort the retrieved items by an attribute of that item. For example, you can
    sort products by their `created_at` attribute by setting `order` to
    `created_at`:


    ```bash

    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?order=created_at" \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    By default, the sort direction will be ascending. To change it to
    descending, pass a dash (`-`) before the attribute name. For example:


    ```bash

    curl "http://localhost:9000/admin/products?order=-created_at" \

    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}'

    ```


    This sorts the products by their `created_at` attribute in the descending
    order.

      Publishable API Keys can be used to scope Store API calls with an API key,
      determining what resources are retrieved when querying the API.

      For example, a publishable API key can be associated with one or more
      sales channels. When it is passed in the header of a request to the List
      Product store endpoint,

      the sales channels are inferred from the key and only products associated
      with those sales channels are retrieved.

      Admins can manage publishable API keys and their associated resources.
      Currently, only Sales Channels are supported as a resource.

      description: >
        Use a user's API Token to send authenticated requests.


        ### How to Add API Token to a User


        At the moment, there's no direct way of adding an API Token for a user.
        The only way it can be done is through directly editing the database.


        If you're using a PostgreSQL database, you can run the following
        commands in your command line to add API token:


        ```bash

        psql -d <DB_NAME> -U <DB_USER>

        UPDATE public.user SET api_token='<API_TOKEN>' WHERE
        email='<USER_EMAIL>';

        ```


        Where:

        - `<DB_NAME>` is the name of the database schema you use for the Medusa
        server.

        - `<DB_USER>` is the name of the user that has privileges over the
        database schema.

        - `<API_TOKEN>` is the API token you want to associate with the user.
        You can use [this tool to generate a random
        token](https://randomkeygen.com/).

        - `<USER_EMAIL>` is the email address of the admin user you want to have
        this API token.


        ### How to Use the API Token


        The API token can be used for Bearer Authentication. It's passed in the
        `Authorization` header as the following:


        ```

        Authorization: Bearer {api_token}

        ```


        In this API reference, you'll find in the cURL request samples the use
        of `{api_token}`. This is where you must pass the API token.


        If you're following along with the JS Client request samples, you must
        provide the `apiKey` option when creating the Medusa client:


        ```ts

        const medusa = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3,
        apiKey: '{api_token}' })

        ```


        If you're using Medusa React, you can pass the `apiKey` prop to
        `MedusaProvider`:


        ```tsx

        <MedusaProvider
          apiKey='api_token}'
          //...
        >

        ```
      scheme: bearer
    cookie_auth:
      type: apiKey
      in: cookie
      name: connect.sid
      x-displayName: Cookie Session ID
      description: >
        Use a cookie session to send authenticated requests.


        ### How to Obtain the Cookie Session


        If you're sending requests through a browser, using JS Client, or using
        tools like Postman, the cookie session should be automatically set when
        the admin user is logged in.


        If you're sending requests using cURL, you must set the Session ID in
        the cookie manually.


        To do that, send a request to [authenticate the
        user](#tag/Auth/operation/PostAuth) and pass the cURL option `-v`:


        ```bash

        curl -v --location --request POST 'https://medusa-url.com/admin/auth' \

        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

        --data-raw '{
          "email": "user@example.com",
          "password": "supersecret"
        }'

        ```


        The headers will be logged in the terminal as well as the response. You
        should find in the headers a Cookie header similar to this:


        ```bash

        Set-Cookie:
        connect.sid=s%3A2Bu8BkaP9JUfHu9rG59G16Ma0QZf6Gj1.WT549XqX37PN8n0OecqnMCq798eLjZC5IT7yiDCBHPM;

        ```


        Copy the value after `connect.sid` (without the `;` at the end) and pass
        it as a cookie in subsequent requests as the following:


        ```bash

        curl --location --request GET 'https://medusa-url.com/admin/products' \

        --header 'Cookie: connect.sid={sid}'

        ```


        Where `{sid}` is the value of `connect.sid` that you copied.
