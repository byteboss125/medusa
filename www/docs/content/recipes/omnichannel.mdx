# Omnichannel Store

This document guides you through the different documentation resources that will help you build an omnichannel store with Medusa.

## Overview

An omnichannel store provides customers with a seamless shopping experience, no matter where they’re shopping from. Whether they’re buying your products from your online store, a marketplace like Amazon, or through social media, you should provide them with a good experience and handle orders consistently.

Medusa’s headless backend facilitates building an omnichannel store, as your backend and storefront aren’t tightly coupled. You can also utilize plugins and Medusa’s sales channels feature to expand your business into other avenues like marketplaces and social commerce.

## Create Multiple Storefronts with One Backend

When creating an omnichannel commerce store, you’ll likely build multiple webshops or mobile apps. All these storefronts should be able to provide your customers with a similar experience and allow them to browse products and place orders.

Medusa’s headless backend allows all storefronts to interact with Store REST APIs to provide the same commerce functionalities. This separation also gives you the freedom to choose your tech stack for the different storefronts you’re creating.

## Integrate with Marketplaces and Social Commerce

Businesses are no longer bound to sell in their own stores. They can reach their customers through their different shopping channels.

One example is marketplaces like Amazon. Customers searching through Amazon to find products are inadvertently searching through a huge number of third-party stores connected to Amazon’s marketplace.

With Medusa, you can use the Sales Channels feature that allows you to set different product availability across sales channels. You can then integrate with Amazon’s seller program and use their APIs to push your products on Amazon. This integration can be achieved through a custom plugin that you create and install on your Medusa backend.

Another channel that attracts customer sales is social media. Customers browsing a social media app can now find products and buy them. With an approach similar to what was mentioned above, you can create a plugin in your Medusa backend that integrates with social media apps to show your products and sell them to customers on the app.

    }
  },

## Optimize Customer Experience

Each business has a unique brand and wants to provide customers with the best journey and experience. With Medusa’s modular architecture, businesses can focus on bringing their brands to life without any restrictions.

For your storefronts, you can implement the customer journey and design that leads to the best customer experience. The backend does not impose any restrictions on how the frontend is built.

Medusa’s architecture also makes it easier to integrate any third-party services necessary to provide a better customer experience with a plugin. This plugin’s functionality can be accessible to the storefronts connected to the Medusa backend.

For example, if you’ve integrated a search plugin such as Algolia in the Medusa backend, the storefronts can utilize it through the Search Products endpoint. Another example is installing the Stripe payment plugin on the backend, and utilizing it in your storefronts to make payments before placing an order.

      description: 'Learn how to create a plugin.',
    }
  },
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/plugins/overview',
    label: 'Official Plugins',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['bolt-solid'],
      description: 'Check out available official plugins.',
    }
  },
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: 'https://medusajs.com/plugins/',
    label: 'Plugins Library',
    customProps: {
      icon: Icons['bolt-solid'],
      description: 'Check out available community plugins.',
    }
  },
]} />
