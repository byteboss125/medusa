In this chapter, you’ll learn about what the Cache Module is.

## What is a Cache Module?

A Cache Module is used to cache the results of computations such as price selection or various tax calculations.

The underlying database, third-party service, or caching logic is flexible since it's implemented in a module. You can choose from Medusa’s cache modules or create your own to support something more suitable for your architecture.

## Default Cache Module

By default, Medusa uses the In-Memory Cache Module. This module uses a plain JavaScript Map object to store the cache data.

This is useful for development. However, for production, it's highly recommended to use other Cache Modules, such as the [Redis Cache Module](!resources!/architectural-modules/cache/redis).
