In this chapter, you'll learn how to execute an action based on a condition in a workflow using the when-then utility.

## What is the When-Then Utility?

The when-then utility executes an action if a condition is satisfied.

Since if-conditions aren't allowed in the workflow constructor function, use the when-then utility if you want to execute a step based on a condition.

## How to Use the When-Then Utility?

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["15", "input", "The data to pass as a parameter to the function in the second parameter"],
  ["17", "return", "The function must return a boolean value indicating whether\nthe callback function passed to `then` should be executed."],
  ["19", "() => {", "The function to execute if `when`'s second parameter returns a `true` value."]
]

```ts highlights={highlights}
import { 
  createWorkflow,
  when,
} from "@medusajs/workflows-sdk"
// step imports...

type WorkflowInput = {
  is_active: boolean
}

const workflow = createWorkflow(
  "workflow", 
  function (input: WorkflowInput) {
    const result = when(
      input, 
      (input) => {
        return input.is_active
      }
    ).then(() => {
      const stepResult = isActiveStep()
      return stepResult
    })

    // executed without condition
    return anotherStep(result)
  }
)
```

Then `when` utility is a function imported from `@medusajs/workflows-sdk`. It accepts the following parameters:

1. An object or the workflow's input. This data is passed as a parameter to the function in `when`'s second parameter.
2. A function that returns a boolean indicating whether to execute the action.

To specify the action to perform if the condition is satisfied, chain a `then` function to `when` and pass it a callback function. The callback function is only executed if `when`'s second parameter function returns a `true` value.
