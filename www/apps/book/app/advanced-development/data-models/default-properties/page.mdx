In this chapter, you'll learn about the properties available by default in your data model.

When you create a data model, the following properties are created for you by Medusa:

- `created_at`: A `dateTime` property that stores when a record of the data model was created.
- `updated_at`: A `dateTime` property that stores when a record of the data model was updated.
- `deleted_at`: A `dateTime` property that stores when a record of the data model was deleted. When you delete a record, Medusa soft-deletes it by setting the `deleted_at` property to the current date.
