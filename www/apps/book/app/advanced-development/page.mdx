In the previous chapters, you got a brief introduction to Medusa’s basic concepts. However, to build a custom commerce application, you need a deeper understanding of how you can utilize these concepts for your business use case.

The next chapters dive deeper into each concept. By the end of these chapters, you’ll be able to:

- Expose API routes with control over authentication, parsing request bodies, and more.
- Create data models with complex fields and relations.
- Manage data models in services.
- Link data models in your module to data models of other modules.
- Emit and handle custom events.
- Create advanced workflows with steps across services and third-party systems.
