In this document, you’ll learn about what the service factory is and how to use it to create a service.

## What is the Service Factory?

Medusa provides a service factory that your module’s services can extend. The service factory implements data management methods for the data models you specify.

If your service provides functionalities to manage the records of a data model, it’s encouraged to extend the service factory.

## How to Extend the Service Factory?

<Note type="check">

Your module must be using the following loaders from the previous chapters:

- [Container Loader](../container/page.mdx).
- [Connection Loader](../connection-loader/page.mdx).

</Note>

The `ModulesSdkUtils` imported from `@medusajs/utils` has a utility function `abstractModuleServiceFactory` that creates a service instance with basic data management methods.

So, to create a service that extends the service instance returned by the factory, call `abstractModuleServiceFactory` and extend its returned value:

```ts title="src/modules/hello/service.ts"
import { ModulesSdkUtils } from "@medusajs/utils"
import { MyCustom } from "./models/my-custom"

class HelloModuleService extends ModulesSdkUtils
  .abstractModuleServiceFactory(
    MyCustom, []
  ) {
    // TODO implement custom methods
  }

export default HelloModuleService
```

### Function Parameters

The `abstractModuleServiceFactory` function accepts two parameters:

1. The first parameter is the main data model this service is creating methods for. It's the `MyCustom` in the example above.
2. The second parameter is an array of data models to generate methods for. If you have the `AnotherCustom` data model, this is where you add it.

### Generated Methods

The service factory generates the following methods for the main data model:

- `list`: Returns an array of records based on filters and pagination configurations.
- `listAndCount`: Returns a tuple of an array of records and the total count of available records based on the filters and pagination configurations provided.
- `retrieve`: Returns a record by its ID.
- `delete`: Deletes records by an ID or filter.
- `softDelete`: Soft-deletes a record by an ID or filter. This only applies if the data model has a `deleted_at` field.
- `restore`: Restores a soft-deleted record by an ID or filter. This only applies if the data model has a `deleted_at` field.

For other provided data models, the same methods are generated, with the data model’s name appended to the end of the method. For example, `listAnotherCustom` or `retrieveAnotherCustom`.

### Type Arguments

For a better development experience and accurate typing of the generated methods, the `abstractModuleServiceFactory` function accepts three type arguments:

export const typeArgsHighlights = [
  ["24", "InjectedDependencies", "The type of dependencies resolved from the Module's container."],
  ["25", "MyCustomDTO", "The expected input/output type of the main data model's generated methods."],
  ["26", "AllModelsDTO", "The expected input/output type of the generated methods of every data model."],
]

```ts title="src/modules/hello/service.ts" highlights={typeArgsHighlights}
import { ModulesSdkUtils } from "@medusajs/utils"
import { MyCustom } from "./models/my-custom"

type MyCustomDTO = {
  id: string
  name: string
}

type InjectedDependencies = {
  // TODO add dependencies
}

type AllModelsDTO = {
  MyCustom: {
    dto: MyCustomDTO
  }
}

// add other data models in your module here.
const generateMethodsFor = []

class HelloModuleService extends ModulesSdkUtils
  .abstractModuleServiceFactory<
    InjectedDependencies,
    MyCustomDTO,
    AllModelsDTO
  >(MyCustom, generateMethodsFor) {
    // TODO implement custom methods
  }

export default HelloModuleService
```

1. The first one is the type of the injected dependencies received as the first parameter of the service’s constructor. You use this type to specify the resources to resolve from the module’s container.
2. The second one is the expected input and output type of the main data model’s methods (for example, the `list` method). This is useful to infer the correct input/output of the generated methods of the main model.
3. The third type is the expected input and output type of all data models that the service factory generates methods for (for example, the `listAnotherCustom` method). This is useful to infer the generated methods for each specified data model, with the correct input/output for each of them.

## Test it Out

To test out the service, create an API route at `src/api/store/custom/route.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/api/store/custom/route.ts"
import { MedusaRequest, MedusaResponse } from "@medusajs/medusa"
import HelloModuleService from "../../../modules/hello/service"

export async function GET(
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
): Promise<void> {
  const helloModuleService: HelloModuleService = 
    req.scope.resolve(
      "helloModuleService"
    )

  res.json({
    my_customs: await helloModuleService.list(),
  })
}

```

Then, start your Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Finally, send a request `GET` request to `/store/custom`:

```bash apiTesting testApiUrl="http://localhost:9000/store/custom" testApiMethod="GET"
curl http://localhost:9000/store/custom
```

You’ll receive the following response:

```json
{
  "my_customs": []
}
```

In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to add create and update methods to the service generated by the service factory.
