In this chapter, you’ll learn about middlewares and how to create them.

## What is a Middleware?

A middleware is a function executed when a request is sent to an API Route.

---

## How to Create a Middleware?

Middlewares are defined in the special file `src/api/middleware.ts`. The file must export an object of middleware configurations.

For example:

```ts title="src/api/middleware.ts"
import { MiddlewaresConfig } from "@medusajs/medusa"

export const config: MiddlewaresConfig = {
  routes: [
    {
      matcher: "/store*",
      middlewares: [
        (req, res, next) => {
          console.log("Received a request!")

          next()
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

The middleware configurations object has the property `routes`. Its value is an array of middleware route objects, where each object is a middleware to apply to a route pattern.

In the example above, you define a middleware that logs the message `Received a request!` whenever a request is sent to an API route path starting with `/store`.

<Note>

The `matcher` property can be a string or a regular expression.

</Note>

### Test Middleware

To test the middleware, start the application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Then, send a request to any API route starting with `/store`, such as `localhost:9000/store/products`:

```bash apiTesting testApiUrl="localhost:9000/store/products" testApiMethod="GET"
curl localhost:9000/store/products
```

Once you send the request, you’ll see the following message in the terminal:

```bash
Received a request!
```

## When to Use

<Note type="success" title="Use middlewares when">

- You want to guard API routes by a custom condition.
- You're modifying the request body.
- You're registering custom resources in the Medusa container.

</Note>

---

## Middleware Function Parameters

The middleware function accepts three parameters:

1. A request object of type `MedusaRequest`.
2. A response object of type `MedusaResponse`.
3. A function of type `MedusaNextFunction` that executes the next middleware in the stack.

<Note title="Important">

You must call the `next` function in the middleware. Otherwise, other middlewares and the API route handler won’t execute.

</Note>

---

## Restrict HTTP Methods

In addition to the `matcher` configuration, you can restrict which HTTP methods the middleware is applied to.

The object in the `routes` array accepts the property `method` whose value is either a string or an array of strings. Each string is an allowed HTTP method. If no value is specified, the middlewares are applied to requests of all HTTP methods.

For example:

export const highlights = [["7", "", "Apply the middleware only on `POST` requests"]]

```ts title="src/api/middlewares.ts" highlights={highlights}
import { MiddlewaresConfig } from "@medusajs/medusa"

export const config: MiddlewaresConfig = {
  routes: [
    {
      matcher: "/store*",
      method: "POST",
      middlewares: [
        (req, res, next) => {
          console.log("Received a request!")

          next()
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

This applies the middleware only when a `POST` request is sent to an API route path starting with `/store`.
