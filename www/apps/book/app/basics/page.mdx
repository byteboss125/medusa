In the next chapters, you’ll learn about the basic concepts of Medusa. These concepts are central to your Medusa development.

By the end of these chapter, you’ll be able to:

- Expose your custom functionalities through REST APIs.
- Create custom modules that define custom business logic.
- Create custom data models.
- Perform asynchronus actions when an event occurs.
- Execute scripts when the Medusa application starts.
- Create scheduled jobs that run at a specified pattern during the Medusa application's runtime.
- Create flows as a series of steps involving multiple services.
- Customize the admin dashboard to inject components on existing pages or add new pages.

You'll then use this knowledge to learn more about Medusa's modular architecture, and how to make customizations to core models and features.
