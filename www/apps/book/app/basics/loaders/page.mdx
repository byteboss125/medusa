In this chapter, you’ll learn about loaders and how to use them.

## What is a Loader?

A loader is a function executed when the Medusa application starts.

A loader can be created either within a module or in the `src/loaders` directory.

<Note>

This guide explains the first approach. This second approach will be explained in later chapters.

## How to Create a Loader?

A loader is created in a TypeScript or JavaScript file under the `loaders` directory of a module. The file must export the loader function.

For example, create the file `src/modules/hello/loaders/hello-world.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/modules/hello/loaders/hello-world.ts"
export default function helloWorldLoader() {
  console.log(
    "[HELLO MODULE] Just started the Medusa application!"
  )
}
```

### Export Loader in Module Definition

You must export your loaders in the module definition. Otherwise, your Medusa application won't run them.

To do that, import the loader in `src/modules/hello/index.ts` and export it in the module's definition:

```ts title="src/modules/hello/index.ts"
// other imports...
import helloWorldLoader from "./loaders/hello-world"

// ...

export default {
  // ...
  loaders: [helloWorldLoader],
}
```

The value of the `loaders` property of the module definition is an array of loader functions.

### Test Loader

Start the Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Among the messages logged in the terminal, you’ll see the following message:

```bash
[HELLO MODULE] Just started the Medusa application!
```

## When to Use

<Note title="Use loaders when" type="success">

- You're performing an action at application start-up.
- You're establishing a one-time connection with an external system.
- You're registering a custom resource in the container.

</Note>

<Note title="Don't use loaders if" type="error">

- You want to perform an action continuously or at a set time pattern in the application. Use scheduled jobs instead, which is explained in the next chapter.
