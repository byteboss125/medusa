This document showcases the link modules defined between the Pricing Module and other commerce modules.

## Fulfillment Module

A shipping option's price is stored as a price set. Medusa defines a link module that builds a relationship between the `PriceSet` and `ShippingOption` data models.

## Product Module

A product variantâ€™s prices are stored as prices belonging to a price set. Medusa defines a link module that builds a relationship between the `ProductVariant` and the `PriceSet`.

So, when you want to add prices for a product variant, you create a price set and add the prices to it. You can then benefit from adding rules to prices or using the `calculatePrices` method to retrieve the price of a product variant within a specified context.
