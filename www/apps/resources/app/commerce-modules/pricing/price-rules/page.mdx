In this document, you'll learn about price rules for price sets and price lists.

## Price Rule

Prices can be restricted by rules. Each rule of a price is represented by the [PriceRule data model](/references/pricing/models/PriceRule).

The `Price` data model has a `rules_count` property, which indicates how many rules, represented by `PriceRule`, are applied to the price.

For exmaple, you create a price restricted to `10557` zip codes.

A price can have multiple price rules. For example:

For example, a price can be restricted by a region and a zip code.

## Price List Rules

Rules that can be applied to a price list are represented by the [PriceListRule data model](/references/pricing/models/PriceListRule). The `rules_count` property of a `PriceList` indicates how many rules are applied to it.
