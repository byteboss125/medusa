export const metadata = {
  title: `Payment Provider not showing in checkout`,
}

# {metadata.title}

You add payment providers to your Medusa instance by adding them as plugins in `medusa-config.js`:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
const plugins = [
  // ...
  {
    resolve: `medusa-payment-stripe`,
    options: {
      api_key: STRIPE_API_KEY,
      webhook_secret: STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
    },
  },
]
```

And installing them with your favourite package manager:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install medusa-payment-stripe
```

However, to also show them as part of your checkout flow you need to add them to your regions.

Then, refer to this user guide to learn how to enable the [payment provider in a region](!user-guide!/settings/regions/providers).
