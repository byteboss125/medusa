# How to Create a Payment Provider

In this document, you’ll learn how to create a Payment Provider to be used with the Payment Module.

## Overview

A payment provider is used to handle and process payments, such as authorizing, capturing, and refund payments.

Refer to [this guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/experimental/payment/payment-provider/) to learn more about payment providers.

Refer to [this guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/experimental/payment/payment-flow/) to learn more about the payment flow.

## How to Create a Payment Provider

A payment provider is a TypeScript or JavaScript class that extends the `AbstractPaymentProvider` class imported from `@medusajsa/utils`.

You can create the payment provider in a module or plugin, then pass that module/plugin in the Payment Module's `providers` option. You can also pass the path to the file
that defines the provider if it's created in the Medusa application's codebase.

For example:

```ts
abstract class MyPayment extends AbstractPaymentProvider<MyConfigurations> {
  // ...
}
```

---

## Configuration Type Parameter

The `AbstractPaymentProvider` class accepts an optional type parameter that defines the type of configuration that your payment provider expects.

For example:

```ts
interface MyConfigurations {
  apiKey: string
}

abstract class MyPayment extends AbstractPaymentProvider<MyConfigurations> {
  // ...
}
```

---

## Identifier Property

The `PaymentProvider` data model has 2 properties: `id` and `is_enabled`.

```ts
class MyPaymentProvider extends AbstractPaymentProvider<MyConfigurations> {
  static identifier = "my-payment"
  // ...
}
```

---

## PROVIDER Property

The `PROVIDER` static property is used when registering the provider in the dependency container. Typically, it would have the
same value as the `identifier` property.

```ts
class MyPaymentProvider extends AbstractPaymentProvider<MyConfigurations> {
  static PROVIDER = "my-payment"
  // ...
}
```

---

## PaymentProviderError

Before diving into the methods of the Payment Provider, you'll notice that part of the expected return signature of these method includes `PaymentProviderError`.

```ts
interface PaymentProviderError {
  error: string
  code?: string
  detail?: any
}
```

While implementing the Payment Provider's methods, if you need to inform the Payment Module that an error occurred at a certain stage,
return an object having the attributes defined in the `PaymentProviderError` interface.

For example, the Stripe payment provider has the following method to create the error object, which is used within other methods:

```ts
abstract class StripeBase extends AbstractPaymentProvider {
  // ...
  protected buildError(
   message: string,
   error: Stripe.StripeRawError | PaymentProviderError | Error
 ): PaymentProviderError {
   return {
     error: message,
     code: "code" in error ? error.code : "unknown",
     detail: isPaymentProviderError(error)
       ? `${error.error}${EOL}${error.detail ?? ""}`
       : "detail" in error
       ? error.detail
       : error.message ?? "",
   }
 }

  // used in other methods
  async retrievePayment(
    paymentSessionData: Record<string, unknown>
  ): Promise<
    PaymentProviderError |
    PaymentProviderSessionResponse["session_data"]
  > {
    try {
      // ...
    } catch (e) {
      return this.buildError(
        "An error occurred in retrievePayment",
        e
      )
    }
  }
}
```

## Type parameters

<TypeList types={[{"name":"TConfig","type":"`object`","description":"","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}  sectionTitle="AbstractPaymentProvider"/>

## constructor

You can use the `constructor` of your Payment Provider to have access to resources in your application through the [dependency container](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/fundamentals/dependency-injection).

You can also use the constructor to initialize your integration with the third-party provider. For example, if you use a client to connect to the third-party provider’s APIs,
you can initialize it in the constructor and use it in other methods in the service.

The payment provider also can access the configurations of the module or plugin it's created in as a second parameter.

### Example

```ts
class MyPaymentProvider extends AbstractPaymentProvider<MyConfigurations> {
  // ...
  constructor(container, config) {
    super(container, config)
    // you can access options here

    // you can also initialize a client that
    // communicates with a third-party service.
    this.client = new Client(options)
  }
  // ...
}
```

### Parameters

## capturePayment

This method is called when a payment should be captured. The payment is captured in one of the following scenarios:

- The payment provider supports automatically capturing the payment after authorization.
- The merchant requests to capture the payment after its associated payment session was authorized.
- A webhook event occurred that instructs the payment provider to capture the payment session. Learn more about handing webhook events in [this guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/experimental/payment/webhook-events/)

In this method, you can interact with the third-party provider and perform any actions necessary to capture the payment.
